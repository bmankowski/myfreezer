# API Implementation Plans Summary

This directory contains comprehensive implementation plans for all REST API endpoints of the MyFreezer application. Each plan provides detailed guidance for the development team including security considerations, error handling, performance optimization, and step-by-step implementation instructions.

## Created Implementation Plans

4. **004-get-container-details.md** - GET `/api/containers/{container_id}`
   - Detailed container view with shelves and items
   - Hierarchical data structure

5. **005-update-container.md** - PUT `/api/containers/{container_id}`
   - Update container name and type
   - Ownership verification via RLS

6. **006-delete-container.md** - DELETE `/api/containers/{container_id}`
   - Delete empty containers only
   - Business logic enforcement

7. **007-get-container-contents.md** - GET `/api/containers/{container_id}/contents`
   - Voice-optimized container contents view
   - Different structure than detailed view

### Shelf Endpoints

9. **009-update-shelf.md** - PUT `/api/shelves/{shelf_id}`
   - Update shelf name and position
   - Handle position conflicts

10. **014-delete-shelf.md** - DELETE `/api/shelves/{shelf_id}`
    - Delete empty shelves only
    - Cascading deletion handling

### Item Endpoints
11. **010-search-items.md** - GET `/api/items`
    - Search and filter items across containers
    - Pagination and location information

12. **012-add-item.md** - POST `/api/shelves/{shelf_id}/items`
    - Add items with automatic quantity aggregation
    - AI name normalization integration

13. **015-update-item-quantity.md** - PUT `/api/items/{item_id}`
    - Set specific item quantities
    - Handle zero quantity deletion

14. **016-remove-item-quantity.md** - PATCH `/api/items/{item_id}/remove`
    - Decrease quantities with consumption tracking
    - Support voice "took out" commands

15. **017-delete-item.md** - DELETE `/api/items/{item_id}`
    - Hard delete items regardless of quantity
    - Permanent removal operations

16. **018-move-item.md** - PATCH `/api/items/{item_id}/move`
    - Move items between shelves
    - Cross-container validation

### Voice Command Endpoints
17. **011-process-voice-command.md** - POST `/api/voice/process`
    - Complex AI-powered voice command processing
    - Multi-action command support
    - OpenRouter + GPT-4o-mini integration

18. **013-voice-query.md** - POST `/api/voice/query`
    - Natural language item queries
    - AI-powered search and response generation

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 - Core CRUD Operations
- Health check (001)
- Container CRUD (002, 003, 004, 005, 006)
- Shelf CRUD (008, 009, 014)
- Basic item operations (012, 015, 017)

### Phase 2 - Search and Advanced Operations  
- Item search (010)
- Container contents (007)
- Item quantity operations (016)
- Item movement (018)

### Phase 3 - AI Integration
- Voice command processing (011)
- Voice queries (013)

## Key Implementation Notes

### Security
- All endpoints (except health check) require JWT authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) automatically enforces user data isolation
- Hierarchical security through container → shelf → item relationships
- Input validation and UUID format verification on all endpoints

### Performance
- Optimized database queries with proper JOIN operations
- Index usage for text search and relationship queries
- Pagination support for large datasets
- AI service caching strategies

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive HTTP status code usage (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- Detailed error messages and validation feedback
- Graceful degradation and partial success handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Technology Integration
- Astro 5 API routes with TypeScript
- Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- OpenRouter AI service integration
- Proper DTO type safety throughout

Each implementation plan provides complete guidance for building production-ready API endpoints with proper security, error handling, and performance considerations.
