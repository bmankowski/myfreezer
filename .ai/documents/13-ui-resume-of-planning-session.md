1. **Progress Indicator Design**: Implement a thin ring around the microphone button edge with 2px thickness and color transition from blue to amber to red over 30 seconds
2. **Container Layout**: Use proportional sizing based on content with minimum width constraint of 320px, no maximum width constraint
3. **Toast Notifications**: Implement 2-second duration floating toasts with queue system and hover-to-persist functionality
4. **Content Structure**: Always visible lists with unlimited vertical expansion for hierarchical structure (Containers → Shelves → Items)
5. **Search Results**: Hide non-matching items during search, highlighted within existing container layout with smooth fade transitions
6. **Offline Handling**: Display banner at the top of the page with non-dismissible yellow indicator
7. **Loading States**: Overlay loading spinners on top of existing container content with semi-transparent backdrop
8. **Container Color Scheme**: Freezers use blue colors (border-blue-400, bg-blue-50), fridges use orange colors (border-orange-400, bg-orange-50)
9. **Edit Interface**: Small centered modals with just input field for container/shelf name editing
10. **Toast Positioning**: Fixed floating toasts at top-right viewport (top: 1rem, right: 1rem) that maintain position regardless of scroll
11. **Performance Strategy**: Load all containers with scrolling, implement virtual scrolling for lists exceeding 100 items
12. **Microphone Button**: Fixed position at bottom center with 2rem margin and safe-area-inset-bottom for mobile compatibility
13. **Navigation Pattern**: Single scrollable page with all functionality accessible without separate views
14. **Search Interface**: Sticky header with debounced input (300ms) and clear button functionality
15. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Use Shadcn/ui AlertDialog for destructive actions like container deletion

</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>

1. **Circular Progress Ring**: Design a smooth CSS animation using stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset for the microphone button progress indicator
2. **Responsive Grid Layout**: Implement CSS Grid with minmax(320px, 1fr) for automatic responsive behavior without maximum constraints
3. **Toast Queue Management**: Create a sophisticated toast system that shows one at a time with automatic stacking and queue processing
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use subtle alternating row backgrounds for item lists exceeding 10 items to improve readability
5. **Search Transitions**: Implement 200ms fade-out/fade-in animations for hiding/showing items during search filtering
6. **Offline Messaging**: Clear, informative banner with specific message: "You're offline. Voice commands and data sync are unavailable."
7. **Loading Interaction Blocking**: Use pointer-events-none during loading states to prevent user interaction conflicts
8. **Color System Consistency**: Apply hover states that darken border colors for interactive feedback
9. **Modal Keyboard Support**: Implement ESC to cancel and Enter to save functionality with real-time validation
10. **Performance Optimization**: Use react-window library for virtual scrolling implementation in large lists
11. **Mobile Safety**: Implement safe-area-inset-bottom CSS for proper mobile browser compatibility
12. **Component Architecture**: Create unified voice command status component with clear state management
13. **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper fallback UI components for graceful error handling
14. **TypeScript Integration**: Use interfaces that match API response structures for type safety
15. **Accessibility Features**: Implement proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management

### Main Requirements Regarding UI Architecture

The MyFreezer MVP requires a **voice-first, responsive web application** built with **Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind 4, and Shadcn/ui**. The primary interaction model centers around voice commands with comprehensive visual feedback, supporting both desktop and mobile users across various device types.

### Key Views, Screens, and User Flows

**Single-Page Application Structure:**
- **Main Dashboard**: Single scrollable page containing all functionality
- **Header Section**: Sticky search input with real-time filtering capabilities
- **Container Grid**: Responsive grid layout for freezer/fridge containers
- **Hierarchical Display**: Containers → Shelves → Items with always-visible structure
- **Fixed Elements**: Bottom-center microphone button and floating toast notifications

**Primary User Flows:**
1. **Voice Interaction Flow**: Microphone activation → 30-second recording with progress indicator → AI processing → visual feedback via toasts
2. **Manual Management Flow**: Container creation → shelf organization → item management through direct UI interaction
3. **Search and Discovery Flow**: Text search → real-time filtering → highlighted results within existing layout
4. **Edit Operations Flow**: Modal-based editing for container/shelf names with keyboard shortcuts

### Strategy for API Integration and State Management

**State Management Architecture:**
- **React Context**: Global app state and user authentication management
- **Local Component State**: UI-specific states (modals, forms, loading indicators)
- **React Query/SWR**: Server state management with automatic caching and synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with server reconciliation for better perceived performance

**API Integration Pattern:**
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for containers, shelves, and items
- **Voice Command Processing**: Dedicated endpoint for AI-powered voice command interpretation
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Automatic data refresh and conflict resolution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user-friendly fallback states

### Issues Concerning Responsiveness, Accessibility, and Security

**Responsiveness:**
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Desktop/tablet (≥768px) with 2-column grid, mobile (<768px) with single-column layout
- **Container Sizing**: Minimum 320px width with proportional growth, unlimited vertical expansion
- **Touch Optimization**: Larger touch targets and appropriate spacing for mobile interactions
- **Orientation Handling**: Consistent layout with adjusted padding for landscape mode

**Accessibility:**
- **Voice Alternative**: All voice operations accessible through keyboard shortcuts and manual interface
- **ARIA Implementation**: Comprehensive labeling for dynamic content and state changes
- **Focus Management**: Proper tab order and focus indicators throughout the application
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Structured content hierarchy and meaningful element descriptions

**Security:**
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration through Supabase Auth
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level data isolation between users
- **Real-time Data**: No client-side caching to ensure fresh data integrity
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive system information

### Technical Implementation Specifications

**Component Architecture:**
- **Container Component**: Manages individual freezer/fridge display and interactions
- **Shelf Component**: Handles shelf-level operations and item organization
- **Item Component**: Individual product display with edit/delete capabilities
- **Voice Interface**: Unified voice command status with recording, processing, and feedback states
- **Search Component**: Real-time filtering with debounced input and result highlighting

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implementation for lists exceeding 100 items using react-window
- **Lazy Loading**: Container contents loaded only when visible
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with server synchronization
- **Efficient Re-rendering**: React 19 features including useTransition for smooth state updates

**Visual Design System:**
- **Color Coding**: Blue palette for freezers, orange palette for fridges
- **Consistent Spacing**: Tailwind 4 design tokens for unified spacing and typography
- **Interactive States**: Hover effects, loading states, and transition animations
- **Toast System**: Comprehensive notification system with queuing and stacking
- **Modal Design**: Focused, small modals for editing operations with keyboard support

<unresolved_issues>

1. **Voice Command Accessibility**: The MVP explicitly excludes accessibility alternatives for voice commands, potentially limiting usability for users with speech or hearing impairments
2. **Offline Functionality**: While offline indicators are planned, the application lacks offline functionality, which could impact user experience in poor connectivity scenarios
3. **Performance Limits**: No defined limits on container, shelf, or item quantities, which could impact performance with very large datasets
4. **Multi-device Synchronization**: Potential conflicts when users access the application simultaneously from multiple devices
5. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: No fallback mechanism defined for when AI voice processing fails or misinterprets commands
6. **Data Export**: No mechanism for users to backup or export their inventory data
7. **Browser Compatibility**: Dependency on Web Speech API may limit functionality in browsers with poor or no speech recognition support
8. **Mobile Browser Variations**: Different mobile browsers may handle the fixed microphone button and safe area insets differently
9. **Large Content Scrolling**: While virtual scrolling is planned for items, no optimization specified for users with hundreds of containers
10. **Voice Feedback Volume**: No user controls specified for adjusting voice response volume or enabling/disabling audio feedback
