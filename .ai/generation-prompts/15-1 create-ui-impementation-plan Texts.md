# Prompt: Frontend View Implementation Plan

As a senior frontend developer, your task is to create a **detailed implementation plan** for a new view in a web application.  
The plan should be **comprehensive** and **clear enough** for another frontend developer to properly and efficiently implement the view.

First, review the following inputs:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD):
   <prd>
   @3-prd.md
   </prd>

2. View Description:
   <view_description>

### 2.4 Generate Exercise Page

- Path: `/exercise/new`
- Main Purpose: Configure and trigger AI text + question generation.
- Key Information: Select target language, proficiency level, topic input, public/private toggle, "Generate" button.
- Key Components: FormPanel (Selects, Input, Toggle, Button), LoadingSkeleton overlay.
- UX/Accessibility/Security: ARIA labels on all controls, focus management to first field, protected route.
  </view_description>

3. User Stories:
   <user_stories>

### US-001

**Title:** Generate Learning Text and Questions Based on Language, User Input, and Proficiency

**Description:** As a language learner, I want to select my target language (English or Spanish), enter a topic of my choosing, and select my proficiency level so that I can generate a new text and practice reading comprehension in my chosen language.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can select their target language (English or Spanish).
- User can input a topic for text generation.
- User can select proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- System generates a text of 100-200 words in the selected language on the entered topic at the selected level.
- Generated text is displayed clearly on the screen.
- System automatically generates 4 open questions based on the text in the same language (English or Spanish).
- Questions are relevant to the content of the text.
- Questions are varied in their focus (e.g., not all asking for the same type of information).
- The first question is displayed clearly after the text.
- User can generate a new text if desired.

### US-009

**Title:** Set Visibility for Generated Text in English or Spanish
**Description:** As a language learner, I want to choose whether my newly generated text (in English or Spanish) is public or private so that I can control its visibility and sharing options.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A toggle or option is provided during text generation to select between public and private.
- When public, the text is displayed in community feeds; when private, it remains accessible only in my personal dashboard.
- The system confirms the chosen visibility setting after text generation.ew

4. Endpoint Description:
   <endpoint_description>

#### Create Text with Questions

- Method: POST
- Path: `/api/texts`
- Description: Generates a new text and associated questions based on user inputs
- Request Structure:
  ```json
  {
    "language_id": "uuid",
    "proficiency_level_id": "uuid",
    "topic": "string",
    "visibility": "public|private"
  }
  ```
- Response Structure:
  ```json
  {
    "text": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "string",
      "content": "string",
      "language_id": "uuid",
      "proficiency_level_id": "uuid",
      "topic": "string",
      "visibility": "public|private",
      "word_count": "integer",
      "created_at": "timestamp",
      "updated_at": "timestamp"
    },
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "text_id": "uuid",
        "content": "string",
        "created_at": "timestamp",
        "updated_at": "timestamp"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Success Codes: 201 Created
- Error Codes: 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error (for AI generation failures)

6. Type Definitions:

Before creating the final implementation plan, conduct an analysis and planning phase within the <implementation_breakdown> tags in your thinking section.  
This section can be quite long because it is important to be thorough.

In your implementation breakdown, perform the following steps:

1. For each input section (PRD, User Stories, Endpoint Description, Endpoint Implementation, Type Definitions, Tech Stack):
   - Summarize the key points
   - List any requirements or constraints
   - Note any potential challenges or important issues
2. Extract and list the key requirements from the PRD
3. List all the necessary major components, along with a short description of each, needed types, supported events, and validation conditions
4. Create a high-level component tree diagram
5. Identify required DTOs and custom ViewModel types for each view component. Explain these new types in detail, breaking down their fields and related types.
6. Identify potential state variables and custom hooks, explaining their purpose and usage
7. List required API calls and their corresponding frontend actions
8. Map each user story to specific implementation details, components, or features
9. List user interactions and their expected outcomes
10. List the conditions required by the API and how to validate them at the component level
11. Identify potential error scenarios and suggest how to handle them
12. List potential challenges with implementing the view and suggest possible solutions

---

After completing the analysis, deliver the **final implementation plan** in **Markdown format** with the following sections:

## Final Plan Sections

1. Overview: A short summary of the view and its purpose.
2. View Routing: Define the path where the view should be accessible.
3. Component Structure: Outline the main components and their hierarchy.
4. Component Details: For each component, describe:
   - Component description, purpose, and its structure
   - Main HTML elements and child components it consists of
   - Supported interactions (events)
   - Validation conditions (detailed according to API)
   - Types (DTO and ViewModel) required by the component
   - Props the component receives from its parent (component interface)
5. Types: A detailed description of the types required for implementing the view, including a full breakdown of any new types or view models by fields and types.
6. State Management: A detailed description of how state will be managed within the view, and whether a custom hook is required.
7. API Integration: Explain how to integrate with the provided endpoint. Clearly point out request and response types.
8. User Interactions: A detailed description of user interactions and how to handle them.
9. Conditions and Validation: Describe what conditions are verified by the interface, which components are involved, and how they affect the UI state.
10. Error Handling: Describe how to handle potential errors or edge cases.
11. Implementation Steps: A step-by-step guide to implementing the view.

Make sure your plan **complies with the PRD**, **addresses the user stories**, and **aligns with the provided tech stack**.

The final output should be **in English** and saved in a file named `.ai/{view-name}-view-implementation-plan.md`.  
**Do not include any of the analysis and planning** in the final deliverable.
