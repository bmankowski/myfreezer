# Frontend View Implementation Task

Your task is to implement a frontend views based on the provided implementation plans and implementation rules. Your goal is to create a detailed and precise implementation that follows the given plan, accurately represents the component structure, integrates with the API, and handles all specified user interactions.


For every plan:

<implementation_plan>
Review implementation plan from directory @.ai/documents/view-plans
</implementation_plan>

Next, review the implementation rules:

<implementation_rules>
Look for rules in: .cursor/rules: shared.mdc, @frontend.mdc, @astro.mdc, @react.mdc, @ui-shadcn-helper.mdc
</implementation_rules>

Then, review the defined types:

<types>
@types.ts
</types>

Implement the plan according to the following approach:

Carefully analyze the implementation plan and rules. Pay particular attention to the component structure, API integration requirements, and user interactions described in the plan.

Follow these steps to implement the frontend view:

## 1. Component Structure

- Identify all components listed in the implementation plan.
- Create a hierarchical structure for these components.
- Ensure that the responsibilities and relationships of each component are clearly defined.

## 2. API Integration

- Identify all API endpoints listed in the plan.
- Implement the necessary API calls for each endpoint.
- Handle API responses and properly update component states.

## 3. User Interactions

- List all user interactions specified in the implementation plan.
- Implement event handlers for each interaction.
- Ensure that each interaction triggers the correct action or state change.

## 4. State Management

- Identify the required state for each component.
- Implement state management using the appropriate method (local state, custom hook, shared state).
- Ensure that state changes trigger the necessary re-renders.

## 5. Styling and Layout

- Apply the specified styling and layout as mentioned in the plan.
- Ensure responsiveness if required by the plan.

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Implement error handling for API calls and user interactions.
- Consider and handle potential edge cases listed in the plan.

## 7. Performance Optimization

- Implement any performance optimizations specified in the plan or rules.
- Ensure efficient rendering and minimize unnecessary re-renders.

## 8. Testing

- If specified in the plan, implement unit tests for components and functions.
- Thoroughly test all user interactions and API integrations.

Throughout the implementation process, strictly adhere to the provided implementation rules. These rules take precedence over any general best practices that may conflict with them.

Make sure your implementation accurately reflects the provided plan and follows all specified rules. Pay special attention to component structure, API integration, and user interaction handling.
