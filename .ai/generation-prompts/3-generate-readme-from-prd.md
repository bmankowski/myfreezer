# Task: Create README.md for GitHub Project

You are an experienced developer tasked with creating a `README.md` file for a GitHub project. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, well-structured README that follows best practices and includes all relevant information from the provided project files.

Here are the project files you need to analyze:

<prd>  
@3-prd.md  
</prd>

<tech_stack>  
@4-tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

<dependencies>  
@package.json  
@.nvmrc  
</dependencies>

Your task is to generate a `README.md` file with the following structure:

1. Project name  
2. Project description  
3. Tech stack  
4. Getting started locally  
5. Available scripts  
6. Project scope  
7. Project status  
8. License

### Instructions:

1. Carefully review all provided project files.  
2. Extract relevant information for each README section.  
3. Organize the information into the specified structure.  
4. Ensure you follow these GitHub README best practices:
   - Use clear and concise language  
   - Include a table of contents for longer READMEs  
   - Use proper Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)  
   - Provide clear setup and run instructions  
   - Include badges where applicable (e.g., build status, version, license)  
   - Link to additional documentation if available  
5. Carefully verify that all essential information from the input files is included.

### Before writing the final README:

Wrap your analysis inside <readme_planning> tags in a "thinking block". In this section:
- List key information from each input file separately (PRD, tech stack, dependencies).  
- Draft a brief outline for each README section.  
- Note any missing information that may be needed for a complete README.

This process ensures the README is accurate and well-organized.

After completing the analysis, provide the full contents of `README.md` in Markdown format.

Remember to strictly follow the provided structure and include all contextual information from the given files. Your goal is to create a README that not only matches the specified format but also provides comprehensive and useful information to anyone accessing the project repository.

The final output should be the creation of a `README.md` file in the root of the project, formatted in English Markdown, and should not repeat or replicate any work done in the `readme_planning` section.
