Your task is to implement the **user interface elements (pages and forms)** for the **login**, **registration**, and **account recovery** process. The specification can be found in:

```
@15-3-intoroduce-auth-spec.md
```

Please keep in mind the assumptions and guidelines defined in:

- `@astro.mdc`
- `@react.mdc`
- `@supabase-auth.mdc`

Use a **styling approach consistent with**:

```
{{EXISTING_COMPONENTS}}
```

> **Important:**  
Do **not** implement any backend logic or application state management â€” those parts will be addressed later.
