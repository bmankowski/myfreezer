3. Prepare a detailed summary of the conversation that includes:
   a. Main requirements for the database schema
   b. Key entities and their relationships
   c. Important issues regarding security and scalability
   d. Any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification
4. Format the results as follows:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List the decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
[List the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered]
</matched_recommendations>
