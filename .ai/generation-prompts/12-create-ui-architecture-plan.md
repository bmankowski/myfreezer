You are an AI assistant tasked with helping plan the user interface architecture for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in the next prompt to create a detailed UI architecture, user journey maps, and navigation structure.

Please carefully review the following information:

<product_requirements>
@.ai/documents/3-prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
@.ai/documents/tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

<api_plan>
@8-api-plan.md
</api_plan>

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects relevant to UI design. Consider the following:

    Identify key views and screens based on product requirements and available API endpoints.

    Determine potential user flows and navigation between views, taking API capabilities into account.

    Consider UI components and interaction patterns that may be necessary for effective communication with the API.

    Think about interface responsiveness and accessibility.

    Assess security and authentication requirements in the context of API integration.

    Consider any specific UI libraries or frameworks that may benefit the project.

    Analyze how the API structure affects the UI design and data flows in the application.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any uncertainties, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective UI architecture. Consider questions related to:

    Hierarchy and organization of views in relation to the API structure

    User flows and navigation supported by available endpoints

    Responsiveness and adaptation to different devices

    Accessibility and inclusiveness

    Security and authorization at the UI level in relation to API mechanisms

    Design consistency and user experience

    Application state management and synchronization strategy with the API

    Handling of error and exception states returned by the API

    Caching strategies and performance optimization in communication with the API

The output should follow this structure:

<ui_architecture_planning_output>
<questions>
[List your questions here, numbered]
</questions>
<recommendations> [List your recommendations here, numbered] </recommendations> </ui_architecture_planning_output>

Remember that your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations that will help create a solid UI architecture for the MVP, fully integrated with the available API endpoints. Focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy in your output. Do not include any additional comments or explanations outside the specified output format.

Continue this process by generating new questions and recommendations based on the given context and user responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of the results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations outside the specified output format.
