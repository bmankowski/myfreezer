You're a skilled TypeScript developer tasked with creating a library of DTO (Data Transfer Object) types and Command Models for the application. Your task is to analyze the database model definitions and the API plan, and then create the appropriate DTO types that accurately represent the data structures required by the API, while maintaining the connection with the underlying database models.

First, carefully review the following input data:

1. Database models:
<database_models>
@7-database-strucutre.md
</database_models>

2. API Plan (including defined DTO):
<api_plan>
@8-api-plan.md
</api_plan>

Your task is to create TypeScript type definitions for the DTOs and Command Models specified in the API plan, ensuring that they are derived from the database models. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the database models and the API plan.
2. Create DTO types and Command Models based on the API plan, using the database entity definitions.
3. Ensure consistency between the DTOs and Command Models and the API requirements.
4. Use appropriate TypeScript functions to create, narrow, or extend types as needed.
5. Perform a final review to ensure that all DTOs are included and correctly connected to the entity definitions.

Before producing the final result, work within the <dto_analysis> tags in your thought process to show your reasoning and ensure that all requirements are met. In your analysis:
- List all DTOs and Command Models defined in the API plan, numbering each of them.
- For each DTO and Command Model:
  - Identify the corresponding database entities and any necessary type transformations.
  - Describe the TypeScript functions or tools you plan to use.
  - Create a brief outline of the DTO and Command Model structure.
- Explain how you will ensure that each DTO and Command Model is directly or indirectly connected to the entity type definitions.

After conducting your analysis, provide the final type definitions for the DTOs and Command Models, which should be placed in the file src/types.ts. Use clear and descriptive names for your types and add comments to explain any complex type manipulations or non-obvious relationships.

Remember:
- Make sure that all DTOs and Command Models defined in the API plan are included.
- Each DTO and Command Model should directly refer to one or more database entities.
- When necessary, use TypeScript functions such as Pick, Omit, Partial, etc.
- Add comments to explain any complex or non-obvious type manipulations.

The final outcome should consist solely of the DTO and Command Model type definitions that you will write in the file src/types.ts, without duplicating or re-performing any work done in the thought process block.
